## Overview

This repository serves as a template for building projects or extensions based on Isaac Lab. It allows you to develop in an isolated environment, outside of the core Isaac Lab repository.

**Key Features:**

- `Isolation` Work outside the core Isaac Lab repository, ensuring that your development efforts remain self-contained.
- `Flexibility` This template is set up to allow your code to be run as an extension in Omniverse.

**Keywords:** extension, template, isaaclab


### Installation


- Throughout the repository, the name `real_robot_lab` only serves as an example and we provide a script to rename all the references to it automatically:

```
# Rename all occurrences of real_robot_lab (in files/directories) to your_fancy_extension_name
python scripts/rename_template.py your_fancy_extension_name
```

- Install Isaac Lab, see the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/setup/installation/index.html).

- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

```
cd exts/real_robot_lab
python -m pip install -e .
```

#### Set up IDE (Optional)

To setup the IDE, please follow these instructions:

- Run VSCode Tasks, by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, selecting `Tasks: Run Task` and running the `setup_python_env` in the drop down menu. When running this task, you will be prompted to add the absolute path to your Isaac Lab installation.

If everything executes correctly, it should create a file .python.env in the .vscode directory. The file contains the python paths to all the extensions provided by Isaac Sim and Omniverse. This helps in indexing all the python modules for intelligent suggestions while writing code.


#### Setup as Omniverse Extension (Optional)

We provide an example UI extension that will load upon enabling your extension defined in `exts/real_robot_lab/real_robot_lab/ui_extension_example.py`. For more information on UI extensions, enable and check out the source code of the `omni.isaac.ui_template` extension and refer to the introduction on [Isaac Sim Workflows 1.2.3. GUI](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/introductory_tutorials/tutorial_intro_workflows.html#gui).

To enable your extension, follow these steps:

1. **Add the search path of your repository** to the extension manager:
    - Navigate to the extension manager using `Window` -> `Extensions`.
    - Click on the **Hamburger Icon** (☰), then go to `Settings`.
    - In the `Extension Search Paths`, enter the absolute path to `IsaacLabExtensionTemplate/exts`
    - If not already present, in the `Extension Search Paths`, enter the path that leads to Isaac Lab's extension directory directory (`IsaacLab/source/extensions`)
    - Click on the **Hamburger Icon** (☰), then click `Refresh`.

2. **Search and enable your extension**:
    - Find your extension under the `Third Party` category.
    - Toggle it to enable your extension.


## Code formatting

We have a pre-commit template to automatically format your code.
To install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then you can run pre-commit with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
